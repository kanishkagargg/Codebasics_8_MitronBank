In this project, Mitron Bank, a well-established financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad, is keen on expanding its product offerings and market presence by launching a new line of credit cards. AtliQ Data Services became aware of this initiative through an internal link and approached Mitron Bank with a proposal to execute the project. However, Mr. Bashnir Rover, the strategy director at Mitron Bank, expressed skepticism and requested a pilot project with the sample data before entrusting them with the full-scale implementation.

In response to this, Mitron Bank provided a sample dataset featuring information from 4000 customers across five different cities, encompassing details about their online spending and other relevant information. The objective is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of this provided sample data and present key findings to Mitron Bank's strategy team. The insights derived from this analysis are anticipated to serve as valuable guidance for tailoring the new credit cards to align with customer needs and prevailing market trends.
